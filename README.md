# FlexTogether OnBoarding App

This project was built during Lambda School's Build Week from March 11-14, 2019. FlexTogether is an LA based startup reducing senior loneliness and isolation through remote exercise with family and friends. (Think a cross between Peloton and Skype). FlexTogether’s co-watching experience combines offers pre-recorded fitness videos and live video conferencing. The unique “buddy system” allows seniors to stay connected with friends and loved ones while staying active.

They were scheduled to begin onboarding users for their closed beta approximately a month after this project was completed. A key to a successful beta test will be the ability of senior’s and their buddies to coordinate a time to meet online. This onboarding experience was to help users find a time that works for both of them.
